I've written some tools for NFC on Android, including a working example project for reading and writing real tags. I've also done a simple rewrite of the NFCDemo project you might be interested in.

I've also added broadcast send / receive capability to the NFC Developer app so that more people can play with NFC, i.e. without needing an NFC device.
